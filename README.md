TNL.NET
=======

Torque Network Library rewritten in C#

It is still incomplete. SymmetricCipher isn't implemented.

It also needs heavy testing, becouse I didn't have a lot of time to test ghosting.

Torque Network Library isn't my property. This is just a reimplementation of it in C#, for better compatiblity.
